# AI_trainer
AI_trainer focuses on counting the number of curls done by an individual.
- It takes the angle formed by the right hand for calculations. 
- We will use the pose estimation running on the CPU to find the correct points and using these points we will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles we can find many gestures including the number of biceps curls
