# AI_trainer
AI_trainer focuses on counting the number of curls done by an individual.
- It takes the angle formed by the right hand for calculations. 
- Used OpenCV,MediaPipe along with python
- We will use the pose estimation running on the CPU to find the correct points and using these points we will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles we can find many gestures including the number of biceps curls

### OpenCV 
- OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications.
  It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object
  detection. In this tutorial, we explain how you can use OpenCV in your applications.
  
 ### Python
 - Python was used as its design philosophy emphasizes code
   readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim
   to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
 ### MediaPipe 
 - MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building multimodal audio, video, or any time series data.
With the help of the MediaPipe framework, an impressive ML pipeline can be built for instance of inference models
like TensorFlow, TFLite, and also for media processing functions.
